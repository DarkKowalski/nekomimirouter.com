# Peer with us!

We run mesh networks over multiple endpoints including datacenters, our houses, and school labs. These networks are non-profit, for educational and amateur scientific research purposes.

If you also run non-profit networks, you may peer with us. We run [DN42](https://dn42.eu/) with IPv4/IPv6 and Internet with IPv6. We use BGP for inter-AS routing, [Babel](https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/babel/) and BGP for intra-AS routing.

To reach us, click on the e-mail button on the top-right corner of this page.

Note: we **DO NOT** provide public commercial service, and our services have **no SLA**.
